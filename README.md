# exchange-core

**Ultra-fast market exchange core matching engine** based on LMAX Disruptor and Eclipse Collections (ex. Goldman Sachs GS Collections).

Capable to process 5M commands per second on 7-years old hardware (Intel® Xeon® X5690) without significant latency degradation:

Peak performance: 7M commands per second with awful latency.

Benchmark configuration:
- 1 order book
- 3,000,000 commands distributed as follows: 9% limit, 3% market orders, 6% cancel and 82% move operations. About 6% commands are triggering trades.
- 1,000 active accounts.
- 1,000 limit orders in order book (in average).
- Does not include network interface and IPC latency.
- Test data is not bursty, same interval between commands (very short though: 200ns-8µs).
- No coordinated omission effect. Any processing delay affects upcoming messages.
- GC triggered prior running benchmark cycle.

### Features
- HFT optimized. Priority is a limit-order-move command mean latency (0.5µs). Cancel takes about 0.7µs, new order - 1.0µs;
- In-memory working state.
- Lock-free and contention-free orders matching and risk control algorithms.
- Matching engine and risk control operations are atomic and deterministic.
- Pipeline processing design (LMAX Disruptor), each CPU core is responsible for different operation, accounts shard, or symbol order books set.
- Low GC pressure, often created objects are reused.
- Supports crossing Ask-Bid orders for market makers.
- Testing - unit-tests, integration tests, stress tests.
- Two implementations of matching engine: naive and optimized.

### TODOs
- Journaling support, event-sourcing - snapshot and replay operations support.
- Market data feeds (full order log, L2 market data, BBO, trades).
- Clearing and settlement.
- FIX and REST API gateways.
- More tests and benchmarks.
- NUMA-aware and thread affinity support.
